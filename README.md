# Josef coding challenge

Hello ðŸ‘‹ & welcome to the anvil coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems. If you're having build issues ðŸ”§ with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

The challenge is to build upon a simple Vue.js application.

You may want to install [Vue Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) to enrich your Vue dev experience.

## How it works

- Fork this repo into your own account
- Make a new branch
- When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
- We will take a look at your solution, and we might ask you several questions after

## Coding task

### Frontend 

In `src/views/Layout.vue` you'll find a component that is loading data from an API.

1. Render the list of files from the API.

2. Create a reusable component to render the items, using a combination of [props](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#props) and [slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-slot).

3. The design / UI is open for you to decide ðŸŽ¨. Try to use some of the scss variables in `src/styles/resources/_variables.scss` to give it a Josef feel.

4. Create a [computed property](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html) that takes the files data and filters it for tags that include `kitten` then sorts it by date.

### Backend 

In `src/views/Rules.vue` you'll find a Vue.js view with deatiled instructions about the problem.

1. Modify the `checkGroup` function in the file, so it returns `true` if all rules and groups apply, otherwise `false`.

2. Try your best implement the task in an eficient and elegant way. 

### Extra credit

1. The data is currently being managed locally in `src/views/Layout.vue` and `src/views/Rules.vue`, migrate it to a [vuex module](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html) in `src/store`. *See example in `src/store/user`.*
2. Write some unit tests for your challenge in `/tests/unit`.
