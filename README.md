# Josef coding challenge

Hello üëã & welcome to the Josef coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment, and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense of how you think and solve problems. If you're having build issues üîß with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

The challenge is to build upon a simple Vue.js application.

You may want to install [Vue Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) to enrich your Vue dev experience.

## How it works

- Fork this repo into your account
- Make a new branch
- When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
- We will take a look at your solution, and we might ask you several questions after

## Coding task

### Frontend

In `src/views/Layout.vue`, you'll find a component loading data from an API.

1. Render the list of files from the API.

2. Create a reusable component to render the items, using a combination of [props](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#props) and [slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-slot).

3. The design / UI is open for you to decide üé®. Try to use some of the scss variables in `src/styles/resources/_variables.scss` to give it a Josef feel.

4. Create a [computed property](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html) that takes the file's data and filters it for tags that include `kitten` then sorts it by date.

### Backend

In `src/views/Rules.vue` you'll find a Vue.js view with detailed instructions about the problem.

1. Modify the `checkGroup` function in the file so it returns `true` if all rules and groups apply, otherwise `false`.

2. Try your best to implement the task in an efficient and elegant way.

#### Extra credit

1. The data is currently being managed locally in `src/views/Layout.vue` and `src/views/Rules.vue`, migrate it to a [vuex module](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html) in `src/store`. _See example in `src/store/user`._
2. Write some unit tests for your challenge in `/tests/unit`.

### QA

In `src/views/QA.vue` you'll find a Vue.js view that we want you to test üßê.

1. **API testing:** Using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)(or a tool of your preference), test functionality of the REST API for the `entity` object. Validate listing, creating, editing and deleting objects.
Additionally, test a uniqueness requirement for `entity.id` property. Objects can be accessed and modified using requests:

```
  GET    http://localhost:3000/entities  
  GET    http://localhost:3000/entities/[id] 
  POST   http://localhost:3000/entities  
  PUT    http://localhost:3000/entities/[id] 
  DELETE http://localhost:3000/entities/[id] 
```

2. **e2e frontend testing:** Using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)(or a tool of your preference) test form submission on the QA page.
3. **Extra credit:** Using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) run an audit of the QA page and document your performance and acesebility findings.

When done, save required files in the `tests/` folder and add instructions to the `README.md` üìù.
