# Future tools improvements

### API Testing:

1. Automation and Collection Runs:
- Automate repetitive tasks using scripts in Postman.
- Set up collection runs to execute a series of requests automatically.

2. Environment Variables:
- Utilize environment variables for better flexibility across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
Data-Driven Testing:
- Explore data-driven testing by using variables and data files to iterate over different inputs.
API Documentation:

### E2E Frontend Testing:

1. Parallel Execution:
- Use Cypress parallelization features to speed up test execution.

2. Visual Testing:
- Integrate visual testing tools to detect visual regressions.

### Performance and Accessibility Audits:

1. Continuous Integration (CI):
- Integrate Lighthouse into your CI/CD pipeline to perform automated audits with each build.

2. Third-Party Integrations:
- Integrate Lighthouse with other tools, such as Slack or Jira, to automate notifications or create issues based on audit results.
